Simulation approach and development of innovative algorithms for cost minimization in parallel machine scheduling problems.
In this research, we addressed the problem of scheduling identical machines with the aim of minimizing system costs.
to achieve the goal of the problem, two different approaches of cost minimization by minimizing the completion time of the last pending task and cost minimization by using minimization We considered the weighted sum of late and early arrival times.
Since the model presented in both approaches was very complex, we used innovative methods to solve it and compared their performance using simulation in MATLAB software.
by comparing the two algorithms, the developed PSC algorithm and the proposed GRASP optimization algorithm, we found that they work the same in minimizing the completion time of the last pending task and as a result the overtime cost.
in minimizing the total weighted earliness and lateness, the GRASP algorithm performs better.
Therefore, in the end, the Grasp algorithm has a better performance in minimizing the total costs of the system.
